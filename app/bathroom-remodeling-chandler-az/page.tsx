const chandlerFaqs = [
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit to remodel a bathroom in Chandler, AZ?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the City of Chandler requires a building permit for any project that changes the layout of your bathroom, relocates plumbing pipes, or updates electrical wiring. Cosmetic updates like replacing cabinets, swapping a sink vanity, or installing new flooring in the same position do not require a permit. ARZ Home Remodeling manages the full permitting process directly with the Chandler Development Services Department located on Arizona Avenue."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the average cost of a bathroom remodel in Chandler?",
    answer:
      "Bathroom remodeling costs are highly customized, depending on the size of the room, layout changes, tile choices, and fixture selections. Because every space is unique, we provide free on-site inspections and prepare a detailed, line-item written estimate before any work begins, ensuring a fixed-price guarantee. Contact us today to schedule your free design consultation."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Chandler water hardness affect bathroom tile and glass?",
    answer:
      "Chandler has exceptionally hard water with high levels of calcium. This mineral content causes white scale buildup on traditional porous stone and standard glass doors. We recommend installing large format porcelain tiles with epoxy grout instead of natural stone. Porcelain does not absorb water, and epoxy grout resists staining. For shower doors, we use low iron glass treated with a protective hydrophobic coating."

              Your bathroom is one of the most frequently used spaces in your home, serving as the start and end to your daily routine. However, many Chandler properties built between the 1980s and early 2000s feature outdated, cramped layouts and builder-grade fixtures that fail to meet modern standards of luxury or utility. Yellowing fiberglass tub surrounds, water-damaged particle board vanities, and mildewed tile grout are common issues that detract from both your daily comfort and your home’s resale value. Upgrading your space with professional **bathroom remodeling in Chandler, AZ** is a high-return investment that transforms outdated spaces into modern, functional retreats.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              At ARZ Home Remodeling, we specialize in providing comprehensive design-build remodeling solutions tailored to the needs of Chandler homeowners. From luxury master bathroom overhauls featuring freestanding tubs and curbless entry walk-in showers to space-optimizing guest bathroom updates and expert <Link href='/tub-to-shower-conversion/' className='text-primary hover:underline font-medium'>tub-to-shower conversions</Link>, our in-house crew manages every phase.

              Navigating Chandler Building Codes and Permitting
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Navigating structural modifications, drainage relocations, or electrical circuit expansion requires strict compliance with local building codes. In Chandler, major bathroom renovations require building permit filing and official inspections through the **Chandler Development Services Department** (located at the municipal complex on Arizona Avenue in Downtown Chandler). Our team manages the entire permitting pipeline, drafting and submitting all floor plans, framing details, and plumbing layout designs. We handle structural wall removals, coordinate inspections for wet-area rough-ins, and ensure that every outlet, exhaust fan, and mixing valve meets current safety guidelines.

              Combating Chandler's Hard Water
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              East Valley municipal water is notorious for its exceptionally high mineral content, frequently measuring between 18 to 22 grains of hardness (well over 300 mg/L of dissolved calcium and magnesium). This high-mineral supply leaves heavy white scale buildup on traditional porous natural stone and standard cement grout, leading to discoloration, cracking, and water penetration. To combat this, we install vapor-tight **Schluter-KERDI waterproofing systems** on all shower substrates. We use large-format, non-porous porcelain tile (with water absorption ratings below 0.5% per ASTM C373) and upgrade all joints to 100% solid **epoxy resin grout** that repels minerals, resists staining, and remains easy to clean.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We build all custom tiled showers in compliance with the **Tile Council of North America (TCNA) B421 and B422** standards. Instead of traditional cement boards and PVC liners which degrade and leak, we install the **Schluter-KERDI waterproofing system**.

                  <li><strong>Vapor Permeance:</strong> The KERDI membrane features a water vapor permeance rating of <strong>&lt; 0.5 perms</strong> (tested under ASTM E96 Procedure E), making it completely vapor-tight and preventing steam from rotting your wood framing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Decoupling & Crack Isolation:</strong> The bonded sheet membrane decouples the tile layer from the subfloor, absorbing the natural expansion and contraction of desert framing, preventing grout joints from cracking.</li>

                  The municipal water supply in Chandler averages <strong>over 300 mg/L (18+ grains per gallon) of dissolved calcium and magnesium</strong>. This hard water destroys standard cement grout and stone. We resolve this by strictly adhering to ANSI material guidelines:

                  <li><strong>Epoxy Grout (ANSI A118.3):</strong> We upgrade our grout to 100% solid epoxy resins. Unlike porous cement grouts, epoxy grout is completely non-porous and chemically inert, resisting staining, scale buildup, and acid cleaning.</li>
                  <li><strong>Thin-Set Mortar (ANSI A118.15):</strong> We use improved modified dry-set cement mortar to bond dense, large-format porcelain tiles (water absorption rate <strong>&lt; 0.5%</strong> per ASTM C373), preventing tiles from releasing due to slab movement or moisture cycles.</li>

                  <li><strong>Anti-Scald Mixing Valves:</strong> We install pressure-balancing and thermostatic mixing valves certified to <strong>ASSE 1016 / ASME A112.18.1</strong> standards. This maintains water temperature within &plusmn;3.6&deg;F (&plusmn;2&deg;C) despite pressure drops elsewhere in the home.</li>
                  <li><strong>PEX-a Piping Systems:</strong> We utilize PEX-a (expansion-fitting) piping for supply lines. PEX-a resists hard water scaling, eliminates the risk of pinhole leaks common in aging copper pipes, and absorbs thermal expansion without stress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Drain Expansion:</strong> In all tub-to-shower conversions, we expand the original 1.5-inch waste line to a code-compliant <strong>2-inch waste and vent line</strong> to handle high-flow modern shower heads without back-ponding.</li>
