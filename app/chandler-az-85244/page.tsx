                  The Hidden Challenges Behind Every Older Bathroom
                </h2>
                <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  <p>
                    Remodeling a bathroom in a home that was built several decades ago is an entirely different discipline than working on a newer construction property. The older neighborhoods surrounding the 85244 postal district are filled with homes that have tremendous character and craftsmanship. But behind their walls, you often find a different story altogether. Decades of minor plumbing leaks, shifting foundation slabs, outdated electrical wiring, and aging galvanized pipes create a hidden layer of complexity that standard contractors are simply not prepared to handle.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At <Link href="/" className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium">ARZ Home Remodeling</Link>, we view a complete demolition as an investigation as much as a construction project. When we strip your bathroom down to the bare studs, we are looking for the root causes of your current problems, not just the visible symptoms. We have encountered everything from cast-iron drain pipes that were installed slightly out of level decades ago — causing chronic slow drains — to entire subfloor sections that are so rotten from a slow, long-term toilet flange leak that they need complete replacement before a single tile can be set.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This thorough approach protects your investment. A beautiful new bathroom built on top of a compromised foundation is simply ticking clock. Within a few years, that brand-new tile will begin to crack and grout will crumble, because the underlying structure was never properly addressed. We fix the unseen problems first, and only then do we build the beautiful, lasting custom bathroom that you deserve.

This full-exposure approach lets us inspect every inch of framing, identify historic water damage, assess the plumbing, and start with a completely clean, correctly prepared substrate. We then install Schluter-Kerdi waterproofing membranes across every wall and floor surface before any tile is set. The result is a bathroom built to the highest modern standards, inside an older home with original character and charm.

                  Many older homes near downtown Chandler were built with high-threshold bathtubs that present a serious tripping and falling hazard for aging homeowners. We specialize in converting these outdated, dangerous tub-shower combos into fully accessible, curbless walk-in showers. We incorporate built-in teak benches, stainless steel grab bars strategically positioned at the correct ADA heights, and slip-resistant porcelain floor tiles with a coefficient of friction that exceeds safety standards. Your new shower becomes both a safety feature and a design statement.

                  An older bathroom remodel is often the perfect opportunity to address failing plumbing before it becomes an emergency. When the walls are open, replacing aging galvanized supply lines with modern PEX tubing, upgrading outdated two-handle faucet valves to thermostatic pressure-balancing cartridges, and re-pitching drain lines are all work that can be done efficiently and affordably. These hidden improvements add decades of reliable function and prevent the very expensive water damage that results from aging pipe failures.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Older bathroom vanities were typically built-in, bulky furniture pieces with small, round sinks and outdated chrome hardware. We replace these with sleek, modern floating vanity bases, which make the room feel more open and make cleaning the floor dramatically easier. We install deeply under-mounted rectangular sinks, seamless quartz countertops without any grout lines to scrub, and frameless mirrors that are wired directly to the electrical for integrated LED lighting. Modern hardware in matte black or brushed nickel ties the entire space together.

We assess the age of the plumbing under the sink, inspect the existing tile for signs of previous leaks, check whether the subfloor feels solid and level underfoot, and talk through any prior repairs you are aware of.

Unlike general handymen who simply rip everything out and move on, we carefully document everything we encounter inside the walls and floor.

This documentation is shared directly with you before we proceed, ensuring complete transparency and giving you the opportunity to make informed decisions about any additional structural remediation."

After demolition, we replace all corroded galvanized piping with clean PEX lines and properly pitch drain runs. We treat and frame out any sections where mold is present and install moisture-resistant Densglass sheathing rather than standard drywall. If the concrete slab is uneven, we pour precision self-leveling compound across the floor and allow it to fully cure before any tile installation begins. Only once the structure is sound do we move to the aesthetic phase of the remodel."

This protects your home from future water infiltration regardless of natural tile movement or minor settling. Our master tile craftsmen then set your chosen porcelain or stone, maintaining perfectly consistent grout joints, plumb vertical lines, and carefully mitered corners. All niches, shelves, and built-in features are tile-set to the same exacting standard as the main walls."

                  q: "My home has old galvanized plumbing everywhere. Can you still remodel just one bathroom?",
                  a: "Yes. We focus on replacing all galvanized supply lines that are accessible within the walls and floor of your specific bathroom project. We can isolate and replumb just the fixtures in that room using modern PEX connections that tap into the main lines. While we strongly encourage homeowners to consider replacing their full plumbing over time, a single-bathroom replumb is absolutely feasible and very beneficial."
                },
                {
                  q: "Do I have to handle the city permits myself?",
                  a: "Absolutely not. Remodeling an older home almost always requires permits, particularly when we are moving drain locations, upgrading electrical panels, or making structural changes to framing. As licensed General Contractors under ROC #338304, we draft and submit all plans directly to the City of Chandler Building Division and coordinate all on-site inspections from start to finish."
                },
                {
                  q: "My bathroom floor seems very uneven. Can you still install large-format tile?",
                  a: "Large-format tiles, typically 24x24 or larger, are incredibly unforgiving on an uneven substrate. If you lay them on an unlevel slab, they will crack within a year or two due to inadequate contact underneath. Before any tile touches your floor, our crews will pour self-leveling compound or hand-float the concrete to ensure it is perfectly flat. This critical step is what separates a long-lasting tile installation from one that fails prematurely."
                },
                {
                  q: "How long does it take to remodel a bathroom in an older home?",
                  a: "Older homes require significantly more preparation time than new construction projects. A full gut restoration in a 85244 property typically runs between 4 to 6 weeks of active construction. The additional time accounts for structural repairs, waiting for self-leveling compounds to fully cure, the longer permit review times associated with older properties, and the extra care required when working around aged plumbing and electrical systems. We always provide a realistic timeline upfront so you can plan your daily routine accordingly."
