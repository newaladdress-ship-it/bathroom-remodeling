    question: "How much does a bathroom remodel cost in Apache Junction?",
    answer:
      "Bathroom remodeling costs in Apache Junction depend on layout changes, square footage, tile selections, and fixture choices. We provide free on-site inspections and prepare a detailed, line-item written estimate before any work begins, ensuring a fixed-price guarantee. Contact us today to schedule your quote."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you need a permit for bathroom remodeling in Apache Junction?",
    answer:
      "Yes, major structural, electrical, or plumbing alterations require building permits from the City of Apache Junction Building Division. Permits ensure all safety codes are met, especially in older East Valley homes. Simple cosmetic swaps like replacing vanity cabinets or standard floor tile updates do not require permits. We manage the entire permitting process for you."
  },
  {
    question: "What materials work best in Apache Junction's hard water?",
    answer:
      "Apache Junction's municipal water has exceptionally high mineral counts, averaging over three hundred milligrams per liter of dissolved solids. We recommend porcelain tile because it is non porous and resists white scale stains far better than natural stone. We also exclusively use epoxy grout, which resists mineral penetration and discoloration, and premium plywood vanities that stand up to summer humidity."

              A recent project completed near the <strong>Superstition Foothills</strong> community involved remodeling a spacious guest bathroom. We replaced an old builder-grade acrylic tub with a beautiful walk-in tile shower using sand-toned textured porcelain tile, secure wall-anchored grab bars, and dynamic slip-resistant mosaic flooring to ensure comfort, luxury, and safety.

                  1. Waterproofing & Moisture Control (TCNA Standards)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We build all custom tiled showers in compliance with the **Tile Council of North America (TCNA) B421 and B422** standards. Instead of traditional cement boards and PVC liners which degrade and leak, we install the **Schluter-KERDI waterproofing system**.
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Vapor Permeance:</strong> The KERDI membrane features a water vapor permeance rating of <strong>&lt; 0.5 perms</strong> (tested under ASTM E96 Procedure E), making it completely vapor-tight and preventing steam from rotting your wood framing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Decoupling & Crack Isolation:</strong> The bonded sheet membrane decouples the tile layer from the subfloor, absorbing the natural expansion and contraction of desert framing, preventing grout joints from cracking.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                  2. Hard Water Mitigation & Tile Standards (ANSI A118)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The municipal water supply in Apache Junction averages <strong>over 300 mg/L (18+ grains per gallon) of dissolved calcium and magnesium</strong>. This hard water destroys standard cement grout and stone. We resolve this by strictly adhering to ANSI material guidelines:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Epoxy Grout (ANSI A118.3):</strong> We upgrade our grout to 100% solid epoxy resins. Unlike porous cement grouts, epoxy grout is completely non-porous and chemically inert, resisting staining, scale buildup, and acid cleaning.</li>
                  <li><strong>Thin-Set Mortar (ANSI A118.15):</strong> We use improved modified dry-set cement mortar to bond dense, large-format porcelain tiles (water absorption rate <strong>&lt; 0.5%</strong> per ASTM C373), preventing tiles from releasing due to slab movement or moisture cycles.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="p-6 bg-secondary rounded-2xl border border-border">

                  3. Advanced Plumbing & Scald Prevention (ASSE 1016)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Modern mechanical systems are essential to safety and system longevity. We upgrade and secure every in-wall plumbing component:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Anti-Scald Mixing Valves:</strong> We install pressure-balancing and thermostatic mixing valves certified to <strong>ASSE 1016 / ASME A112.18.1</strong> standards. This maintains water temperature within &plusmn;3.6&deg;F (&plusmn;2&deg;C) despite pressure drops elsewhere in the home.</li>
                  <li><strong>PEX-a Piping Systems:</strong> We utilize PEX-a (expansion-fitting) piping for supply lines. PEX-a resists hard water scaling, eliminates the risk of pinhole leaks common in aging copper pipes, and absorbs thermal expansion without stress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Drain Expansion:</strong> In all tub-to-shower conversions, we expand the original 1.5-inch waste line to a code-compliant <strong>2-inch waste and vent line</strong> to handle high-flow modern shower heads without back-ponding.</li>
