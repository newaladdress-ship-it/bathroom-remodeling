Persistent stains that won't clean despite your best efforts make your bathroom look dated and unclean. Rust spots and discoloration indicate the tub's protective coating has failed. If your tub feels unstable or flexes when you step in, the support structure may be compromised.

A new bathroom vanity provides essential storage, improves daily functionality, and serves as a focal point for your bathroom's design. Our experienced installers handle every aspect of vanity installation, from removing old cabinets and updating plumbing to setting new vanities perfectly level and installing countertops with precision. We work with all vanity styles including single and double sink configurations, floating wall-mounted designs, and traditional floor-standing cabinets.",

            "Selecting the right bathroom vanity involves balancing style, size, storage, and budget considerations. Measure your bathroom carefully to determine the maximum vanity size that allows comfortable movement. Single-sink vanities work well in powder rooms and smaller bathrooms, while double-sink vanities accommodate busy households and master bathrooms. Consider storage needs-drawers provide better organization than cabinets for most items. Vanity height has evolved from the traditional 30-32 inches to comfort height at 36 inches, which reduces back strain during daily use. Material choices include solid wood for durability and classic appeal, engineered wood with moisture-resistant finishes for budget-friendly options, and metal or glass for contemporary designs. Countertop materials range from affordable laminate to luxurious quartz, granite, or marble. We help you navigate these options to find the perfect vanity for your needs.",

Plumbing is inspected and updated as needed, with supply lines and drain assemblies positioned to match your new vanity configuration. Wall blocking is added if necessary to support wall-mounted vanities. We set the vanity cabinet, shimming and leveling it precisely to prevent door and drawer misalignment. Countertops are installed with proper support and sealed seams. Sinks are mounted and plumbed with new faucets and drain assemblies. Backsplashes are installed and caulked for a watertight seal. Finally, we connect all plumbing, test for leaks, and clean the work area thoroughly. Most vanity installations in Chandler are completed in one day, minimizing disruption to your household.",

Traditional vanities feature furniture-style details, raised panel doors, and classic hardware in rich wood finishes. Transitional vanities blend traditional and contemporary elements with clean lines and subtle details. Modern vanities emphasize minimalism with flat-panel doors, sleek hardware, and bold finishes. Floating vanities mount to the wall, creating an airy feel and making floor cleaning easier. Vessel sink vanities showcase decorative above-counter sinks as design statements. Farmhouse vanities incorporate rustic elements like distressed finishes and apron-front sinks. We help you select a vanity style that complements your bathroom's architecture and your personal aesthetic, ensuring a cohesive, polished result.",

Drawer organizers keep toiletries, cosmetics, and grooming tools neatly arranged and easily accessible. Pull-out shelves in lower cabinets maximize storage capacity and improve access to items in back corners. Electrical outlets integrated into drawers or on the side of the vanity provide convenient power for hair dryers and electric toothbrushes. Adequate lighting above or beside the vanity eliminates shadows for grooming tasks. Medicine cabinets or open shelving add supplementary storage without consuming floor space. Soft-close hinges and drawer glides provide quiet, smooth operation. We consider these functional elements during planning to ensure your new vanity enhances your daily routine while maintaining a clean, organized appearance.",
