    question: "Do I need a permit for a bathroom remodel in Gilbert, AZ?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the Town of Gilbert requires a building permit for residential bathroom remodels that alter structural walls, relocate drain systems, or run new electrical circuits. Cosmetic work like replacing a mirror or installing a new faucet does not require building permits. ARZ Home Remodeling submits all plans directly to the Gilbert Building Permits department on Civic Center Drive. We guarantee our work passes all town inspections."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the safety requirements for an ADA bathroom remodel in Gilbert?",
    answer:
      "An ADA compliant bathroom remodel focuses on safety and ease of use. The Americans with Disabilities Act standards require grab bars that support up to 250 pounds of force. We install grab bars directly into structural wall studs, not just drywall. Walk in showers must have a slip resistant floor rating. We use mosaic tiles because the extra grout lines provide traction. Toilets must have a seat height of 17 to 19 inches from the floor, which makes sitting and standing much easier."

              Your bathroom is a sanctuary where you begin and end your day, yet many Gilbert homes built during the rapid expansions of the 1990s and early 2000s are showing significant wear. Builder-grade acrylic surrounds yellow and crack, structural subfloors leak from age, and massive garden tubs sit unused, consuming valuable footprint. Furthermore, Gilbert's mineral-rich water supply accelerates white calcium scale buildup, clogging fixtures and staining porous stone. If you are planning to update your space, our specialized team delivers durable, high-density craftsmanship designed for Arizona's unique environment.

              At ARZ Home Remodeling, we specialize in delivering comprehensive, custom bathroom remodeling in Gilbert, AZ. From zero-threshold, curbless walk-in showers in Power Ranch to high-end master suite makeovers in Morrison Ranch and Val Vista Lakes, we handle the entire project under a single, fixed-price contract. We are actively professional with the Arizona Registrar of Contractors (), providing services across communities in the <span className="text-primary font-semibold">85233, 85234, 85295, 85296, 85297, and 85298</span> ZIP codes.

              Building codes and municipal oversight are critical for safety and home resale value. In the Town of Gilbert, shifting plumbing fixtures, removing load-bearing partitions, or adding dedicated electrical circuits requires formal permit submittals and code inspections. We handle all design planning and permit filings directly with the **Town of Gilbert Development Services Department** (located at the civic center complex on Civic Center Drive). We ensure that every wall modification, drain line slope, and ASSE 1016 anti-scald valve replacement complies with local residential code guidelines.

              A recent project completed on a spacious family home in <strong>Morrison Ranch</strong> involved converting a dated 2000s guest bathroom. We removed the old fiberglass tub alcove and installed a custom walk in tile shower with Schluter Kerdi waterproofing, a frameless heavy glass enclosure, non porous porcelain tile with high performance epoxy grout, and a beautiful double vanity topped with stain resistant quartz.

                  1. Waterproofing & Moisture Control (TCNA Standards)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We build all custom tiled showers in compliance with the **Tile Council of North America (TCNA) B421 and B422** standards. Instead of traditional cement boards and PVC liners which degrade and leak, we install the **Schluter-KERDI waterproofing system**.
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Vapor Permeance:</strong> The KERDI membrane features a water vapor permeance rating of <strong>&lt; 0.5 perms</strong> (tested under ASTM E96 Procedure E), making it completely vapor-tight and preventing steam from rotting your wood framing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Decoupling & Crack Isolation:</strong> The bonded sheet membrane decouples the tile layer from the subfloor, absorbing the natural expansion and contraction of desert framing, preventing grout joints from cracking.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="p-6 bg-secondary rounded-2xl border border-border">
                <h3 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">

                  2. Hard Water Mitigation & Tile Standards (ANSI A118)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The municipal water supply in Gilbert averages <strong>over 300 mg/L (18+ grains per gallon) of dissolved calcium and magnesium</strong>. This hard water destroys standard cement grout and stone. We resolve this by strictly adhering to ANSI material guidelines:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Epoxy Grout (ANSI A118.3):</strong> We upgrade our grout to 100% solid epoxy resins. Unlike porous cement grouts, epoxy grout is completely non-porous and chemically inert, resisting staining, scale buildup, and acid cleaning.</li>
                  <li><strong>Thin-Set Mortar (ANSI A118.15):</strong> We use improved modified dry-set cement mortar to bond dense, large-format porcelain tiles (water absorption rate <strong>&lt; 0.5%</strong> per ASTM C373), preventing tiles from releasing due to slab movement or moisture cycles.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="p-6 bg-secondary rounded-2xl border border-border">
                <h3 className="font-serif text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 flex items-center gap-2">
                  <Clock className="w-6 h-6 text-primary" />
                  3. Advanced Plumbing & Scald Prevention (ASSE 1016)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Modern mechanical systems are essential to safety and system longevity. We upgrade and secure every in-wall plumbing component:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Anti-Scald Mixing Valves:</strong> We install pressure-balancing and thermostatic mixing valves certified to <strong>ASSE 1016 / ASME A112.18.1</strong> standards. This maintains water temperature within &plusmn;3.6&deg;F (&plusmn;2&deg;C) despite pressure drops elsewhere in the home.</li>
                  <li><strong>PEX-a Piping Systems:</strong> We utilize PEX-a (expansion-fitting) piping for supply lines. PEX-a resists hard water scaling, eliminates the risk of pinhole leaks common in aging copper pipes, and absorbs thermal expansion without stress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Drain Expansion:</strong> In all tub-to-shower conversions, we expand the original 1.5-inch waste line to a code-compliant <strong>2-inch waste and vent line</strong> to handle high-flow modern shower heads without back-ponding.</li>
                </ul>
