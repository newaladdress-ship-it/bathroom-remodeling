            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A recent project completed near the <strong>DC Ranch</strong> area involved a custom master bathroom renovation. We replaced an oversized unused tub with a large curbless walk-in shower with premium Carrara marble tile, digital Moen U shower valves, floating double-sink vanities, and elegant backlit mirrors.

              If your Scottsdale bathroom upgrade involves structural reconfigurations, partition wall removals, or electrical modifications, we coordinate the complete permitting process with the <strong>City of Scottsdale Planning & Development Department</strong> (located at 7447 E Indian School Rd).
