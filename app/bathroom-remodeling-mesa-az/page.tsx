    question: "Do you need a permit for a bathroom remodel in Mesa, AZ?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you must obtain a permit from the City of Mesa Building Safety Division if your remodel involves structural changes, moving a toilet, or adding new electrical outlets. If you are only replacing a vanity or putting in new tile shower walls without changing the layout, you do not need a permit. Our team handles the application and inspection process with the Mesa Development Services office on Center Street."
  },

    question: "How much does a tub to shower conversion cost in Mesa?",
    answer:
      "Tub-to-shower conversion costs in Mesa depend on layout changes, tile choices, and valve configurations. Converting a tub to a walk-in shower helps prevent slips and makes the room feel much larger. We provide free on-site inspections and prepare a detailed, line-item written estimate before any work begins, ensuring a fixed-price guarantee. Contact us today to schedule your quote."

              Your bathroom is a primary living space that directly influences your daily comfort and your home’s value. In Mesa, AZ, homes built from the mid-20th century to the early 2000s are often ready for significant updates. Outdated layout designs, leaky fiberglass enclosures, and plumbing systems damaged by heavy hard water scale are common problems. Expanding a shower enclosure, upgrading a vanity layout, or executing a modern tub-to-shower conversion are key updates that improve utility. If you are searching for custom **bathroom remodeling in Mesa, AZ**, our local design-build team is here to deliver high-density, leak-proof craftsmanship.

              At ARZ Home Remodeling, we provide end-to-end design and construction services tailored to the unique architectural profiles of Mesa neighborhoods. Whether you want to modernize a hall bathroom in Dobson Ranch, convert a garden tub to a walk-in shower in Las Sendas, or design a luxury master suite retreat in Eastmark, we handle the entire project. We hold active contracting license ROC #338304 and serve homeowners across ZIP codes **85201, 85202, 85203, 85204, 85205, 85206, 85207, 85208, 85212, and 85213**.

              Relocating plumbing lines, expanding shower framing, or running new electrical circuits in Mesa requires strict code compliance. The **City of Mesa Building Safety Division** (located at 55 N Center Street) requires formal building permits and field inspections for these structural and mechanical changes. Our team handles the entire permit administration process, drafting code-compliant plans, coordinating inspections for in-wall rough-ins, and ensuring that all PEX supply lines, ASSE-certified anti-scald valves, and GFCI circuits meet current residential safety standards.

                  1. Waterproofing & Moisture Control (TCNA Standards)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We build all custom tiled showers in compliance with the **Tile Council of North America (TCNA) B421 and B422** standards. Instead of traditional cement boards and PVC liners which degrade and leak, we install the **Schluter-KERDI waterproofing system**.
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Vapor Permeance:</strong> The KERDI membrane features a water vapor permeance rating of <strong>&lt; 0.5 perms</strong> (tested under ASTM E96 Procedure E), making it completely vapor-tight and preventing steam from rotting your wood framing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Decoupling & Crack Isolation:</strong> The bonded sheet membrane decouples the tile layer from the subfloor, absorbing the natural expansion and contraction of desert framing, preventing grout joints from cracking.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="p-6 bg-secondary rounded-2xl border border-border">

                  2. Hard Water Mitigation & Tile Standards (ANSI A118)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The municipal water supply in Mesa averages <strong>over 300 mg/L (18+ grains per gallon) of dissolved calcium and magnesium</strong>. This hard water destroys standard cement grout and stone. We resolve this by strictly adhering to ANSI material guidelines:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Epoxy Grout (ANSI A118.3):</strong> We upgrade our grout to 100% solid epoxy resins. Unlike porous cement grouts, epoxy grout is completely non-porous and chemically inert, resisting staining, scale buildup, and acid cleaning.</li>
                  <li><strong>Thin-Set Mortar (ANSI A118.15):</strong> We use improved modified dry-set cement mortar to bond dense, large-format porcelain tiles (water absorption rate <strong>&lt; 0.5%</strong> per ASTM C373), preventing tiles from releasing due to slab movement or moisture cycles.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div className="p-6 bg-secondary rounded-2xl border border-border">

                  3. Advanced Plumbing & Scald Prevention (ASSE 1016)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Modern mechanical systems are essential to safety and system longevity. We upgrade and secure every in-wall plumbing component:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5 text-muted-foreground text-sm">
                  <li><strong>Anti-Scald Mixing Valves:</strong> We install pressure-balancing and thermostatic mixing valves certified to <strong>ASSE 1016 / ASME A112.18.1</strong> standards. This maintains water temperature within &plusmn;3.6&deg;F (&plusmn;2&deg;C) despite pressure drops elsewhere in the home.</li>
                  <li><strong>PEX-a Piping Systems:</strong> We utilize PEX-a (expansion-fitting) piping for supply lines. PEX-a resists hard water scaling, eliminates the risk of pinhole leaks common in aging copper pipes, and absorbs thermal expansion without stress.</li>
                  <li><strong>Drain Expansion:</strong> In all tub-to-shower conversions, we expand the original 1.5-inch waste line to a code-compliant <strong>2-inch waste and vent line</strong> to handle high-flow modern shower heads without back-ponding.</li>
                </ul>
