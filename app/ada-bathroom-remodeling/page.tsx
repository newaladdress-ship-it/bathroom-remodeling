const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What makes a walk in shower ADA compliant?",
    answer: "An ADA compliant walk in shower must feature a zero threshold entry. This means the shower floor sits level with the bathroom floor, allowing a wheelchair to roll in without obstruction. The shower must measure at least 36 inches by 36 inches for a transfer shower, or 30 inches by 60 inches for a roll in shower. We install hand held shower heads with 60 inch hoses, fold down shower seats, and pressure balancing valves to prevent water temperature spikes."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the safety requirements for an ADA bathroom remodel?",
    answer: "We build our accessible bathrooms according to the ADA Standards for Accessible Design. We also follow the guidelines of the National Tile Contractors Association for wet area waterproofing. Our team helps seniors and individuals with limited mobility live independently in their homes, serving residents near Sun Lakes and active adult communities throughout the East Valley."

                  Mounting safety rails onto simple drywall anchors is extremely dangerous. We install thick solid wood blocking securely
